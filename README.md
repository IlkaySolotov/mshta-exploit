# mshta-exploit
mshta.exe vulnerability can be used to download hta's throught shellcode

shouldn't be hard to understand, anyways, for complete retards, example.asm is 
an assembly file, wich is the "exploited code" itself, where you can edit n shit,
just edit it for your needs as you wish.

exploit.cpp is the exploit part executing the shellcode-converted asm.

not hard to understand, pretty useless exploit, still an exploit.
